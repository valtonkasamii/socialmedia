I’ve developed a fully functional social media app where you can create accounts, create posts, like posts, view users profiles, follow them, switch between seeing all posts or only the users you follow posts etc….

Developed a RESTful API using **Node.js** and **Express**, employing a modular folder structure with a dedicated `routes` folder using `express.Router` for route handling, and a `controllers` folder for functions. 

Integrated **MongoDB** for the database with **Mongoose** to handle complex queries.

Implemented **user authentication** and **authorization** using **JWT tokens**, alongside **bcryptjs** for secure password hashing to protect sensitive data.

Ensured correct use of **HTTP status codes** for both success and error responses, following best practices for accurate status reporting.

Built a fully **responsive frontend** with **React** and **TailwindCSS**, ensuring seamless functionality across various devices. Created many complex functions and used different kinds of react hooks. Used React-Router-Dom for routing.

Deployed my application using Vercel for the frontend and Render for the backend.
